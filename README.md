It is not necessary to run this app locally in order to complete the learning activities, but if you wish to do so you will need a local installation of npm. Begin by installing the npm dependencies with:

    npm install

Then, you can run the app with:

    npm start

Once it is running, you can access it in a browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
